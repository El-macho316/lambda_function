# üìÑ Product Requirements Document (PRD): Fundamental Analysis on Request

## 1. Project Goals and Vision

### üéØ Vision
Build an intelligent, conversational tool that enables investment consultants and clients to obtain **on-demand fundamental analysis** of publicly traded companies. Users should be able to inquire about a stock's valuation, financial health, and key metrics ‚Äî all via a simple chat interface ‚Äî to make faster and smarter investment decisions.

### ‚úÖ Goals
- Deliver real-time and accurate fundamental insights using up-to-date financial data.
- Support natural language queries like "Is Tesla undervalued?" or "Give me a fundamental analysis of Apple."
- Design the module to be **modular and easily integrated** into a broader chatbot ecosystem.
- Introduce a **universal scoring system (0‚Äì100)** for comparing companies.

## 2. Core Features and Functionality

### üí¨ Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Extract company names or tickers and intent from user messages.

### üè¢ Company Lookup
- Resolve company names to stock tickers using a reference mapping or financial API.

### üìà Financial Data Retrieval
- Retrieve real-time financial metrics (P/E, EPS, ROE, Debt/Equity, EV/EBITDA, etc.) using **Yahoo Finance** and/or **Financial Modeling Prep API**.

### üß† Valuation Analysis
- Apply rule-based heuristics to assess company value.
- Classify company as **undervalued**, **fairly valued**, or **overvalued**.

### üìä Scoring Engine
- Compute a **fundamental health score (0‚Äì100)** based on:
  - Profitability (e.g., ROE, Net Margin)
  - Valuation (e.g., P/E, EV/EBITDA)
  - Leverage (e.g., Debt/Equity)
  - Growth (e.g., EPS growth)
- Normalize and weight each metric for **industry-agnostic** comparability.

### üßæ Response Generation
- Return well-formatted summaries with scoring, classification, and rationale.

### ‚ùå Error Handling
- Handle unrecognized tickers, ambiguous inputs, and missing data gracefully.

## 5. User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### üìå User Stories

#### 1. Request Full Analysis
As a user, I want a fundamental breakdown of a company so that I can assess its investment appeal.

#### 2. Metric-Specific Query
As a user, I want to ask about individual financial metrics so I can judge specific factors like valuation or profitability.

#### 3. Valuation Verdict
As a user, I want to know whether a company is undervalued so I can make better buy/sell decisions.

#### 4. Universal Scoring
As a user, I want to see a score (0‚Äì100) for a company's fundamentals so I can compare it easily to others.

#### 5. Input Error Recovery
As a user, if I input an invalid or partial company name, I want the chatbot to guide me toward a valid query.

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- Accepts ticker or company name
- Returns metrics (P/E, EPS, ROE, EV/EBITDA, Market Cap)
- Includes:
  - Valuation label (e.g., undervalued)
  - **Fundamental score (0‚Äì100)**
- Provides rationale in plain English
- Handles errors with clear suggestions

## 6. Lambda Tool: `FundamentalAnalysisTool`

### üéØ Purpose
Retrieve key metrics, compute a universal score, and classify valuation status.

### üßæ Input
```json
{
  "ticker": "AAPL"
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Steps

1. **Fetch Metrics**
   - P/E ratio, EPS, ROE, EV/EBITDA, Debt/Equity, Market Cap
   - Sector average benchmarks (if available)

2. **Score Fundamentals (0‚Äì100)**
   - Weight metrics across 4 categories:
     - Profitability (25%)
     - Valuation (25%)
     - Leverage (25%)
     - Growth/Consistency (25%)
   - Normalize and score relative to ideal thresholds or sector norms

3. **Run Valuation Heuristics**
   - P/E < 15‚Äì20 ‚Üí undervalued
   - EV/EBITDA < 10 ‚Üí value
   - ROE < 10% ‚Üí weak profitability

4. **Generate Output**

### üì§ Output Example
```json
{
  "companyName": "Apple Inc.",
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "peRatio": 18.2,
  "roe": 28.0,
  "evToEbitda": 15.3,
  "score": 83,
  "valuation": "Fairly valued",
  "rationale": "Apple's P/E (~18) and EV/EBITDA (~15) are close to sector averages, and its high ROE (28%) supports a balanced valuation.",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-16T07:27:03.968520Z"
}
```

## 7. Error Handling Examples

### ‚ùå Invalid Ticker
```json
{
  "error": "TickerNotFound",
  "message": "Financial data for ticker 'XYZ' could not be retrieved."
}
```

### ‚ö† Partial Data
```json
{
  "valuation": "Insufficient data",
  "rationale": "P/E ratio was not available. Analysis was based only on ROE and EV/EBITDA."
}
```

## 8. Sample Conversation Flows

**User:** "Is Tesla undervalued?"  
**Agent:**  
> "Tesla (TSLA) appears undervalued. Its P/E is 10 (below typical), and EV/EBITDA is 8. ROE is modest, but multiples support a value signal. Score: 78/100."

**User:** "Give me Apple's score."  
**Agent:**  
> "Apple (AAPL) has a fundamental score of 83/100. Its strong ROE (28%) and stable valuation metrics suggest balanced performance."
